Wash your hands a lot, sneeze and cough into your elbow, stay home when you're sick, don't go to Wuhan. Do those things and you're almost certainly not going to get the flu, which is deadlier and more virulent than COVID-19. 
At #MSC2020, @DrTedros reminded @WHO member states that approaches to controlling Covid-19 must be “guided by evidence and public health priorities.” As panic spreads with the outbreak, will evidence-based public health be its biggest victim? @msnydz1 ⬇️

Italy is now the third country in the world per #Covid_19 infections. Most are in the area I live in. Schools, universities, Churches, theaters and all public events are closed. Soccer matches cancelled. We are in full emergency mode. It will be a tough week.
Italy - At the moment, 26 people are hospitalized in intensive care, almost 20% of the total of 132. https://flutrackers.com/forum/forum/-2019-ncov-new-coronavirus/italy-2019-ncov/830571-italy-lombardy-cluster-covid-19-coronavirus-in-milan-infected-38-year-old-now-hospitalized-no-travel-history-110-cases-5-hcws?p=831066#post831066 h/t tetano #Covid_19 #CoronavirusOutbreak #coronavirus
Just a quick note that the Sonic the Hedgehog movie was originally scheduled to launch Feb 28th in China. COVID-19 has kept cinemas shut since last month and all movie releases have been delayed for an unspecified amount of time. Unclear when a new date will be announced. 
#IndiaHidingCoronaStrike The new strain, called COVID-19, has killed more than 1,300 people, mostly in China, and infected over 64,000 people worldwide. 
"💥BREAKING Many leading Chinese scientists are starting to speak out &amp; say COVID-19 (#coronavirus) originated at a gov’t bioweapons research facility in #Wuhan, NOT in the widely-held belief that it emerged from the city's Huanan seafood markets. #China"
Update from Milan #Lombardie ppl are panicking and rushing into stores #Covid_19 
No to rascism. #CoronavirusOutbreak #Covid_19 #coronavirus #stopracism
No, many physicians including the Health Minister denied the contraction of the #Covid_19. They lie about the number of contracted patients too because by their own numbers the fatality rate in Iran is 20% in opposition to the fatality rate in China ~2%. https://twitter.com/sanambna/status/1231571836141522946
Highlights of President Xi's latest remarks on China's fight against COVID-19 epidemic http://xhne.ws/rO3jm
The Iran's regime prefers its own safety over people's lives. It's depriving people vital information & refuses to take measure to prevent the disease from spreading more. This can affect all people in the world. Help us and urselves too! #IranCorona @WHO #Covid_19 @DrTedros
Thousands of Uyghurs are susceptible to the #coronavirus and yet Communist China continues to keep them locked up in internment camps. This is about the health of innocent people. China must close the camps. 
Iran has become the center of the spread of the #Covid_19 virus in the Middle East. #IranCorona
Some nurses and doctors report they have been instructed not use masks in the hospitals, this clearly puts them and others in danger of infection. Not all hospitals are following proper guidelines for preventing the spread of Covid-19. #IranCorona
Scenes from my local supermarket in Basiglio, south of Milan. Panic stocking up on food because of the #coronavirus. 
"Weird to me that the news is not talking about the COVID-19 acceleration &amp; discussing only politics. Seems like we should be starting to prep people what to expect? But even weirder not one political analyst is asking how this might affect the election. "
"We need to give some kudos to the instincts of pmb and his team Imagine if we hadn't blocked the land borders by now. D'you guys really believe open borders will stop rising inflation in spite of the covid-19 outbreak in Asia? Rice, poultry, &amp; other imported necessities?"
"“The WHO has helped #Iran obtain four European-made sets of diagnostic equipment...”Sanctions have so far caused no problem for imports of [this equipment] &amp; is unlikely to cause any problems,” health ministry spox said. #Covid_19 "
The Iranian authorities are not issuing accurate data on Covid-19, reports from many nurses and doctors indicate a much higher rate of infections. Proper prevention measures are not implemented. Lack of proper Crisis Management can lead to disastrous results in Iran. #IranCorona
So, a day after 2nd batch of British passengers go to the Wirral from the #DiamondPrincess, *with unprotected coachdrivers*, 4 of them test *positive* for #CoVID_19. - All tested negative before travel. - We just let others out from Milton Keynes - We *know* incubation is 27 days 
"With the rising figures on COVID-19 spreading to Italy, Japan, Korea, HK among others it is now now longer a guess whether the epidemic will become a global pandemic. It is becoming one for sure. Only issue is the severity of this global pandemic &amp; how much it can be contained"
The Iranian regime does not provide accurate information about COVID-19. The death toll is higher than official statistics. It is the highest outside China. #IranCorona @cahamelmann @DrTedros

"Prof Neil Ferguson of Imperial College, who specialises in epidemiology of infectious disease, share his concerns in @Channel4News's report on #coronavirus. ""Our best estimates at the moment is that maybe 1% of ppl who get infected might die."", He says. #Covid_19 #COVID #China"
"If you're concerned about COVID-19 - get vaccinated for the flu (dangerous itself + the two can co-occur) - quit smoking, use patch/gum if need be - thoroughly wash/sanitize hands throughout the day; avoid public door knobs, touchscreens, etc - practice not touching your face"
Many countries are slow in responding to COVID-19. Coronavirus overwhelmed hospitals in Wuhan in a short time. China dispatched over 40,000 medical workers to support Wuhan. No other country has this mobilization capability.They must try utmost to prevent situation from worsening
Coronavirus Outbreak: - Pakistan, Armenia, Afghanistan, and Turkey closed their borders with Iran due to coronavirus. - South Korea raised their virus alert to red. - Containment measures underway in Italy to curb the spread of COVID-19.

"A lot of people are asking me if it's safe in Korea for COVID-19. No, it's not safe at the moment. Most schools, gatherings are postponed/cancelled. Many people including myself avoid going to crowded places except work &amp; local grocery stores. What about April? I'm not sure."
4 students from Modares University have been tested positive for #Covid_19. These students have visited the city of Qom (outbreak's epicenter) last week in a group of 100. Now the officials decided to evacuate the dormitory. This disaster will result the spread of the virus. 
.@JeffBezos please lift the paywall in this time of #coronavirus- information is power. People need access to facts. We are tying to prep for a potential pandemic. At least let the articles through reporting what’s happening with #Covid_19 as a public service. 
I have a strong feeling Italy is ranking so high in the COVID-19 stats because it’s the only country with good public free healthcare in the list so far.

I have read the research that says that COVID-19 vaccination is unworkable because reinfection creates increased lethality. I do not believe the folks that give us flawed vaccines to give us a good COVID-19 vaccine!!
Why is the number of COVID-19 cases small in Japan? They DO NOT count patients, They REFUSE to test patients!! Many people are suffering! The Tokyo Olympic games are more important for the government !! Crimes against humanity!! #COVID19
So what does this mean for Canada? With more clusters popping up in Asia, Africa, and Iran, only screening travelers from China is no longer an effective strategy. The infection control community in Toronto is recommending expanded testing. #Covid_19
