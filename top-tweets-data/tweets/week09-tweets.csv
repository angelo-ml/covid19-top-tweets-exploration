A blog post https://hunch.net/?p=13762505 on COVID-19 and ML conferences spelling out my current thoughts. TLDR: It's important to start thinking about contingencies now. If you have ideas/want to help, please speak up.
Basic personal protective measures against the new #coronavirus #Covid_19: 1) Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. 2) Maintain at least 1 meter distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
There's no medicine specifically for treating COVID-19, though remdesivir (made by Gilead) looks promising. Gilead's facilities are in US/CA/IE. Bigger issue is the slowdown of all the other normal drugs, durable medical equipment, and disposable items made in China.

The tail-risk impact of Covid-19 is not just the epidemic itself, but the fact that it highlights the risk of running every major supply chain through a single country. If the last twenty years of Chinese capex are a stranded asset, that's an expensive problem.
Given the number of exported #coronavirus cases from Iran to other countries, coupled with unofficial reports of a far greater number of deaths inside Iran from #covid19, it would strongly suggest that Iran must have a very large outbreak underway.
A Party Congress is a big deal for the Chinese Communist Party. Postponing it signals a tremendous amount of political anxiety. As the economic impact of COVID-19 reverberates, that anxiety will likely intensify. Xi will be under significant pressure.

Glad to hear @DrMikeRyan set expectations that it is likely not possible to absolutely stop spread of #COVID-19 between countries. I agree and it's important that @who continue to say this and set expectations.
"I‚Äôm flying back to the EU today & I‚Äôll wear a mask. ‚ÄúAn infected person spreads #Covid_19 to an average of 2.6 people thru the air. After 10 generations, 1 initial case spawns &gt;3,500, most w/ no or mild symptoms, yet probably infectious.‚Äù Wish me luck! "
"I understand that ""pandemic"" can be a scary word. But I think we can explain what it means (geographic spread) and what it doesn't (certain deaths). Acknowledging the pace with which COVID-19 is spreading and difficulty of stopping it without causing undue harm is important."

To be clear in these difficult times: COVID-19 is the name of the DISEASE caused by the newest coronavirus. The virus itself is called SARS-CoV-2. When the @WHO is talking about the virus it says ‚ÄúSARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19.‚Äù

Harvard epidemiologist says COVID-19 likely will not be contained, and that anywhere from 40-70 percent of people will be infected, but that it will be more or less like the regular flu -- many will not even show symptoms and relatively few will die

Mike Pence, the guy who said condoms aren't effective in preventing STDs and wanted to pray away HIV in Indiana is in charge of the COVID-19 outbreak response. ü•¥
Amazing, the threat of COVID-19 spreading in the U.S. remains low, the containment strategy has been working, kinda like Trump has been saying the past week while Democrats have been saying he hasn't been doing enough or was wrong about it.
BREAKING: The @CDCgov has been informed of the 1st case of the #coronavirus in a person who did not recently return from a foreign country or have contact w/confirmed case. Officials have begun tracing the contacts of the resident to find out how the person may have been infected 
The CDC is telling Americans that they should be prepared for the possibility of a COVID-19 outbreak in their community. Here are steps you can take to be prepared üëá 
Mike Pence, the man who caused an HIV epidemic in southern Indiana during his governorship because he thought shutting down needle exchange programs and cutting funding to agencies that fight such things was doing God‚Äôs will, is now in charge of the COVID-19 situation.
Geez, I feel better, Mike Pence is in charge (she tweets, voice dripping with sarcasm). He‚Äôll save us from Covid-19. And he‚Äôll surely tell us the truth. Help us all!!!

Look. I think if you've followed me for awhile, you know that I'm not prone to hyperbole. But this is an administration that is completely unprepared and I would dare say - completely *unware* of what needs to be done to combat and fight COVID-19.

I'm 100% nitpicking right now, but I wish reporters at the debate, on Twitter, etc. would refer to the coronavirus disease 2019 by its proper WHO designation - COVID-19.

Cannot agree more here. Basically this is contingency planning for Covid-19. Authorities needs to start working thoroughly by creating scenarios and responsive actions based on the situation. As per WHO risk assessment this outbreak is globally on category ‚ÄúHIGH‚Äù.(1/11) 
Thought about #Covid_19 patient at UCD med center, from Solano county. Likely + several days ago - suggests at least 3 days back. Most incubation 2-14 days, mean of 6. So that takes us back probably 9-17 days. Does overlap with arrival of Diamond Princess evacs to Travis AFB 2/16
CDC did not immediately test a patient in what may be the first case of person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 in the general public in the US, the head of a Sacramento health system says.

A lot of discussion about Novel Coronavirus/COVID-19 and whether we should be worried with people citing the common flu. Here's why this pandemic has my attention. Influenza kills about 0.07%-0.12% of those it infects in the U.S. - and it infects millions. /1

We've spoken to the experts to get the best tips on avoiding COVID-19. 
An angry crowd set fire to a clinic in Bandar Abbas, south of #Iran because it had patients in it suffering from #coronavirus. Some people say the patients were from Qom -very far away- and this had angered the mob. There is a sense of panic. Still hard to believe this happened.

"Yesterday @SecPompeo twitted ""I‚Äôm deeply concerned by the spread of #coronavirus in #Iran"" and yet you couldn't grow a spine into saying out loud it was NOT a hoax in OUR Nation. 84,000+ cases worldwide and at least 2,876 deaths. #wtpTEAM #OneVoice1"

What makes Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúhoax‚Äù statement so wrong is that CDC admits only 459 Americans have even been tested for #coronavirus. In comparison, China has tested more than 300,000 people Without more test kits, no one has any idea the extent of this.

Yesterday, Switzerland cancelled all events of more than 1K people bc coronavirus. Last night, Trump called COVID-19 'a hoax'. I wonder if he'll cancel his huge rallies once this contagion grows, or will he just let his people die? #SaturdayMorning

Reliable and good reporting should be accessible to all! Can all news media please make articles related to covid-19 openly available? Follow journals policy. @wellcometrust @gatesfoundation
They say Covid-19 is most dangerous to the elderly, so in the long run Trump might help get rid of McConnell after all. Hell, by 2024 it might be Yang vs Jacob Wohl because all the Boomers will be gone. Wait.......could Trump accidentally be the greatest president ever?

Are there theories as to why markets are reacting so much more to Covid-19 than H1N1 in 2009? H1N1 was huge and likely 10-20% of the world caught it (I did!). Is Covid's link to China the difference? Were markets just so depressed in 2009 that H1N1 didn't make a dent?

How is COVID-19 transmitted? The first cases of COVID-19 were believed to be linked to a live-animal market in China, but the virus has since been spreading from person to person. More on how to prepare for COVID-19: 
"Basic Covid-19 prep. Food for at least 2 weeks preferably 1 month. Basic flu supplies, tylenol, ibuprofen, cough meds, imodium &amp; pepto. Vitamins. Gatorade or pedilyte. TP, tissues, paper towels. Masks for if someone is infected. N95 masks for high risk people."

Trump's COVID-19 press conference was incoherent and contentless. Shouldn't that be news?

This is a great thread on what we should and shouldn‚Äôt be worrying about re: COVID-19. Bottom line: big concern is frontline hospital capacity, and panic is as big a risk to that as actual surge in cases. 
I suffer from one of the preexisting conditions which can make COVID-19 dangerous. While there is a lot of over-reaction going on right now there‚Äôs no reason to poke fun at people who are anxious and scared and trying hard to control their anxiety with preparedness. Be Kind.
Can we all FINALLY agree that the culture of going to work when you‚Äôre sick, and expecting your employees to go to work when they‚Äôre sick, is fundamentally stupid & unhelpful? That‚Äôs been obvious for a very long time BEFORE #CoronaVirus. Maybe it will finally sink in now.

I confess I don't understand the obsession with secrecy around covid 19. More information reduces panic. It's not as if a mob is going to lynch the family of a known patient. If I had it, I'd just tell people, so they could worry/celebrate as appropriate.
Next time a Liberal starts spouting yesterday's #Coronavirus numbers, ask them about yesterday's flu numbers. They won't know despite the fact the flu was far more deadly. That's because the common flu is missing the key #TDS protein that makes #Coronavirus stick to everything.

It‚Äôs very likely that Europe and the US can‚Äôt stop the spread of COVID-19 and will have to accept it eventually. People will view its higher-than-flu mortality rate with a new attitude. If, for a long time, epidemic emerges repeatedly, it will have a profound, overall impact.
The governments of the U.S., Europe, and other countries should come together and help Iran with the #CoronaVirus. NOW. This is not only the ethical thing to do ‚Äî it's mutually beneficial, and it will go a long way toward mending fences. We are one. Separateness is an illusion.

'Contagion' (2011) is popular on Netflix. Watched it again last night. Some of the science is dubious, but seems plausible about how a pandemic could spark a slow-motion collapse of social order. Arguably the best movie made so far about what we might be facing with Covid-19.

Dear @MittRomney: I admire your courage. I appreciate the professionals fighting COVID-19. We don‚Äôt know if the virus was delayed in the US, or if, as some experts have said, we haven‚Äôt adequately tested for it. Putting politics aside also means not jumping to conclusions. 
"Here we are in #FluSeason and the #Coronavirus is spreading. If we had #MedicareForAll our people would have immediate testing and appropriate care. Instead, they can‚Äôt afford doctors, hospitals &amp; medicines. Please elect #Bernie2020 If you actually care about people."
Incubation is 14 days. If COVID-19 has been spreading undetected and not given supportive care, there would be more ill people now or worse, deaths. In schools alone, they would manifest, as children are vulnerable. That‚Äôs not the case. So, yours is an unfounded fear.

What are the symptoms of novel coronavirus, or COVID-19? Novel coronavirus can cause symptoms that range from mild to severe, including cough, fever and shortness of breath. More on how to prepare for COVID-19: 
It's not that confusing. CBP/ICE has previously decided not to immunize detainees--including children--against influenza, despite knowing the risks, and the recommendations of the CDC. They are not planning to do anything to mitigate an outbreak of COVID-19 in their facilities. 
One thing I keep thinking is that if we make it through the COVID-19 outbreak with minimal death and disruption -- we're lucky and it's basically a blip on flu season -- it will be used to justify not making structural changes.

Mike Pence On COVID-19: 'With The Prayers Of Millions Of Americans We're Going To Get Through This' 
So after an entire day of the GOP and Republican Congress members tweeting at us that we should not politicize the COVID-19 outbreak, Mike Pence and Don Jr. politicize the COVID-19 outbreak. Got it.
"Trump‚Äôs bungled response to #Coronavirus should surprise no one. This is how he‚Äôs run his administration from day 1: selfish, chaotic &amp; more concerned with cover-ups than informing the public. #COVID_19 "
Unsurprisingly, #covid_19 has almost certainly been in the US for several weeks. 
To whom it may concern: Being hysterical about Covid-19 on Twitter isn't going to stop it from infecting you. Viruses don't speak English or use social media to the best of my knowledge. Chill tf out.

t–Øump has a personal responsibility to visit & embrace all people in the US who contract COVID-19. 
"Proof that naturopathic ""doctors"" are lacking in the medical education area. Yes, the category of virus known as coronavirus has been around for decades (SARS, MERS, etc). The strain covid-19 is new. This is basic stuff that any medical professional should know. "
"Just a heads up that the 2% mortality for COVID-19 includes people with respiratory diseases or immune system disorders, so while no one means to say ""Everyone will be fine except you!"" that's basically the message that non-biotypical people are hearing a lot these days."
Public health officials have yet to describe COVID-19 as a pandemic, but some say it‚Äôs just a matter of time‚Äîand semantics 
The thing that most worries me about COVID-19 in the United States is that our work culture and health care system are both optimized to amplify a virus like this.
"Classicist word of the day! Panacea, n. From Gk. pan (all) and akos (cure). Alchemists searched for a medicine that would cure all diseases, but now it's mostly used as ""a solution to all problems."" There will be no panacea for the global problems caused by Covid-19."
