One thing to question with COVID-19 is if being more exposed to it increases CFR. There seems to be a lot of healthcare workers and doctors in their 30-40s who have died at larger rates than what we are being told the public suffer. Does increased exposure amplify illness?

COVID-19 is a respiratory virus that can be transmitted through contact with a contaminated surface such as the hose of the hookah. Hookah smoking provides an ideal environment for the spread of various infections including tuberculosis. (1/5)

OK. So, Why are Europeans concerned that #COVID is not spreading in AFRICA? We are Africans, the cradle of Homo Sapiens. H1N1 never came. SARS never came. MERS never came. Avian flu never came. Or they came and we finished them? Coronavirus will never come.
Is there actually an increase in the rate of those being infected with COVID-19 or is there just better testing now so they are being counted? With the media panic over this, anyone with a sniffle is running to the doctor and governments are testing more broadly.
In 2009, the #Media downplayed the H1N1 pandemic because Obama was president, despite fact that the prior H1N1 outbreak, The Spanish Flu in 1918, killed 10's of millions. Yes, The Spanish Flu was H1N1. Can you imagine if The Spanish Flu was COVID-19? It's ALL we'd hear about.

#Covid_19 mortality rate by age 
The two confirmed COVID-19 cases in Indonesia has sparked an ancient debate question: in light of the public health concerns, do we still uphold patient's confidentiality (e.g.: their names, where they live, etc.) or do we release those info? I believe in the former.
"""Wait for all this to blow over"" #coronavirusuk #coronavirus "
In 2009, H1N1 killed mostly healthy persons under 60. COVID-19 kills mostly sickly persons over 60. Because H1N1 attacked the young and healthy, it was MORE dangerous that COVID-19, yet as I recall at the time, there were no stock market panics or warnings of impending collapse.

For the common flu, the mortality rate is about .2%. For COVID-19, it is the same for previously healthy persons under 50. It is the fact COVID-19 attacks the lungs and thus kills the very old and unhealthy at a MUCH higher rate that skews COVID-19 mortality higher.

When to call a doctor: 1. You are in (or have recently been to) a place where COVID-19 is active. 2. You have a fever and a dry cough, which seems to be how this disease /usually/ presents first. Fast detection is key to individual outcome and overall spread. Pass it on.

The @WHO has just put the death rate from #Covid_19 at sitting probably somewhere between 3-4%, which is certainly different to seasonal 'flu. But that doesn't tell the whole story. The elderly appear to have something to be worried about, at least until a vaccine is developed... 
The idea that covid-19 case mortality rate is overestimated compared to the flu is flawed because also the flu cases are underreported. If anything, covid-19 is LESS underreported than the flu. Tests with such wide coverage aren't carried out for the flu.

"The #coronavirus should not be subject to politics in Washington. Price controls eliminate innovative research to find a cure for #COVID19 and delay funding for our state &amp; local governments. We must be sending a bipartisan funding package to the Senate for approval immediately."
"The @NEJM says on average, 1 person infected with #Covid_19 passes it on to 2.2 people. W/ mixed messages from @POTUS who called reports a hoax, &amp; w/ testing failures by @CDCgov , efforts to detect those with it have failed, as officials warn the virus is spreading silently."
We should have voted on a funding bill last week, but Democrats needed more time to politicize this public health emergency. This is not the time for political games. We must come together and pass a clean funding bill to address the #coronavirus ASAP.

COVID-19 is the prototypical Democratic-Socialist virus. It infects and brings misery to all then robs from the old, the vulnerable, and wealthy only to die with them. It has no goal other than to survive and infect, reducing the quality of life for all. üá∫üá∏PI#39

Noted epidemiologist, virologist, and fuckwit chimes in with his personal wild-ass guess about the fatality stats of Covid-19 
Someone needs to stifle, as Archie Bunker used to say. Trump called his pal Hannity last night to lie about the dangers of #coronavirus, which he said was like the regular flu. He said his hunch is the death rate is 1%, when it is 3.4% according to WHO.
"There are new cases of #coronavirus in NYC &amp; NY, NJ. California is in a public health emergency. There are 94,000 cases globally. In China, 780 million people have travel restrictions. In America, Trump calls into Fox and says Americans w/ #Covid19 get better by going to work."

The Government have announced measures that all workplaces with 10 employees or more are to have paid mandatory leave to avoid the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus starting from March 6, 2020. All schools are to close for 6 weeks also from March 6th
Initial Unemployment claims last week, down 3,000, to 216,000, while layoffs were down 26.3% from last year. So far, no evidence that COVID-19 is affecting US economy in any significant manner.
Chinese scientists claim they have identified two strains of COVID-19: one strong, one weak. The strong form was prevalent early and the weak later. As I postulated previously, I believe the strong form came from eating the infected snakes, the weak from human to human.

The Seattle government continues to avoid undertaking the serious and necessary measures that can still help to stall COVID-19 (like required cancelation of large public gatherings, closing of schools, etc.) The truth is, there are really only two ways #COVID19seattle can go:
Trump, an obese septuagenarian with heart disease, had the chance to communicate the extreme dangers of #coronavirus, especially to older people with comorbidities like himself. Instead he‚Äôs telling people they can go to work with it. This is dangerous. 
All school sites in Northshore will be closed beginning Thursday, March 5 for up to 14 days while we continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation. We will communicate plans to transition instruction to online learning beginning Monday, March 9. 
The hospitals and clinics will be the largest place of transmission of the COVID-19 in Canada. Our government is not taking this seriously! Why do they not have testing areas set up? I bet they don't even have an overflow hospital set up anywhere.
"""The global response to COVID-19 has made clear that the fear of contracting disease has an ugly cousin: xenophobia... anti-Asian discrimination has followed closely behind."" "

COVID-19 is not contained in the US. The only reason numbers are low is because the number of people tested is low. At first I thought the lack of test kits was just Trump admin incompetence, but it looks more like the one thing Trump is competent at - running a deliberate con. 
Yes. This is a thing. Smokers should quit smoking to reduce COVID-19 risk. The problem is when an activist, with a recently retracted paper, goes one step further and claims, based on no evidence, that the same is true for vapers.

We each play a vital role in protecting the health of our community. It is of utmost importance to take personal precautions, such as frequent hand washing and wiping down surfaces, in order to help reduce the spread of infection, including COVID-19. 
Since declaring a state of emergency last night, we have continued to ramp up our response to COVID-19 and investigate the three positive cases in Montgomery County.
As well as frequent hand washing, avoiding handshakes can lower the risk of acquiring Coronavirus/Covid-19. Here are some interesting alternatives to consider. üôè‚ô•Ô∏èüìòü¶ã #CoronaVirusChallenge

Math is our friend. Common flu kills 470,000 (average). COVID-19 kills 0.65% infected. Flu kills 0.1%. So this leads to 3,092,000 world deaths from COVID-19. But wait, there is more. R0=1.3 for flu. R0 estimated at 2.6 for COVID-19. This is exponential. Death min=6,184,000. 
The flu has killed far more people than coronavirus. So why all the frenzy about COVID-19?

COVID-19 is one of the LEAST contagious viral strains out there. Mumps and Measles are dramatically worse. Pure #FearPorn lies.
I hear, with ever decreasing sympathy, ‚Äúwell the common flu kills xxx people‚Äù comments. True, but focus. This is good explanation from Dr leading vaccine efforts for #coronavirus (full video in thread) about why the comparison fails. ‚ÄúWhat happens to this virus is up to us.‚Äù 
China has had COVID-19 from the start and affects only .005% of their population. This projects 30% spread in the US? What complete and utter #fearporn rubbish. The people who put out this garbage should be ashamed.

I agree with @pbump that the presser shows that Trump wants to keep down COVID-19 numbers at all costs. I would add that it also showed that the CDC director, a Trump appointee, is fully backing Trump. A possible explanation for the lack of testing

I don‚Äôt understand the toilet paper hoarding. Does COVID-19 cause rampant diarrhea?

Some health depts are testing to exclude the flu rather than for COVID-19 due to the lack of test kits. Not only is Trump's WH incompetent, but they've filled CDC with religious nut jobs like Dr. Redfield who was part of a group claiming AIDS was God‚Äôs judgment on homosexuals.

Italy has the oldest population in Europe. Most new cases and deaths from COVID-19 are appearing in the Lombardy Region with male victims in their 80's and 90's and having pre-existing respiratory problems. So Italy really is like a giant nursing home outbreak.

It's not how many people get COVID-19 that matters. 43 million got infected with the flu in 2018. It's the mortality rate - which has clearly been spiked out of proportion by a lack of general population testing. If COVID-19 doesn't kill or maim you, you were just sick.

"""If Americans could seek testing and care without worrying about co-pays or surprise bills, and if everyone who showed symptoms had paid sick leave, the United States could more easily slow the spread of COVID-19."" Important @juliettekayyem piece:"
You are an elderly person who gets rushed to ER with a bad flu where you test positive for COVID-19. Sadly, you die. Meanwhile there are 100 cases running around with mild infections who never get tested. You just made COVID-19 mortality rates 100 times higher than they are.

I estimate my chance of dying of COVID-19 this year is about 0.04% (20% risk of contraction, 0.2% risk of death). That's against a background annual death rate of 0.16%. So it's a serious deal, but I certainly shouldn't go nuts to incrementally reduce my risk of infection.

U.S. capacity for COVID-19 testing is still a fraction of what is needed, and automatic testing could expand capacity at labs from ~75 a day to ~1,000 a day. But the federal government won't allow it. Why not? No one knows! Right now it's a mystery. https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/08/nyregion/coronavirus-newyork.html
I‚Äôm getting the sense that a relationship exists between the #GOP and people responsible for producing #COVID_19 test kits. How else to explain the continuing lack of kits? Friday we were told 900,000 tests would be available by today. Today the Surgeon General says it‚Äôs 75,000.
Why is it that a country like South Korea can test over 160,000 of their people for the COVID-19 virus, but we to date, have only tested 1583 people? Trump and his idiots have literally guaranteed that we will eventually have a widespread epidemic.

COVID-19 ‚Äúcould be very much like‚Äù the 1918 flu pandemic, which killed 50 million. ‚ÄúThe 1918 flu...was the second-deadliest event of the last 200 years. It is likely that people you know will die from COVID-19.‚Äù 
One of the best ways to slow COVID-19 down is for sick workers to stay home. But only 12 states (and DC) provide paid sick days ‚Äî and American workers can't afford to lose a paycheck.

Remember when Trump said he would release his tax returns? Now he says a million covid 19 tests are available. The truth is closer to a million people want testing and cannot get it.
If COVID-19 stays in the nose and throat, little more than a dry cough will develop. It‚Äôs when it travels to the lungs that mortality becomes a factor. Here we are approaching spring. It‚Äôs estimated that up to 30% experience allergic rhinitis. THIS IS WHY WE NEED TESTING.
‚ÄúIf Americans could seek testing & care without worrying about co-pays or surprise bills & if everyone who showed symptoms had paid sick leave, the US could more easily slow the spread of COVID-19. But a crisis finds a nation as it is, not as its citizens wish it to be.‚Äù

Again folks there is no reason for panic over COVID-19. Concern? Yes. Panic? No. Numbers of individuals testing positive is because testing is now increasing. As we see more testing positive, the mortality rate decreases as most infected have only mild symptoms.

South Korea has expansive COVID-19 testing: 178,000 tests found 7041 positive cases and 46 deaths, or 0.6% confirmed case fatality. This is looking similar to influenza. Increasing testing in the USA would show mild cases and reassure rather than panic

To recap, @MayorBowser presser. DC has its 1st covid-19 case: a man in his 50s, who is hospitalized in DC. A 2nd man with covid-19 in his 50s visited DC with his family and is hospitalized in MD currently. He is believed to be Nigerian. (Neither DC nor MD is claiming that case.)
