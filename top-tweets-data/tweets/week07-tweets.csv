About six weeks ago, China was reporting on the first 41 cases of confirmed #coronavirus in that country. Singapore and Hong Kong have now each hit 50 cases. Modeling suggests that the time from first introduction to epidemic spread is about 10 weeks. 
COVID-19 is *not* the name of the virus, but of the disease. That’s what the D stands for. The *proposed* name of the virus is SARS-CoV-2 per International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. There seems to be confusion about this. It’s analogous to the reln btw AIDS and HIV.

Explainer: How World Health Organization names a new disease as COVID-19. 
WHO (World Health Organization) is predicting the COVID-19 could affect 60% of the world’s population, that’s 2/3 of the world’s population. Based on reiable research, United Nations Agenda 21 plot to depopulate 95% of the world’s population by 2030!
Will the #coronavirus—now #COVID-19—be a cloud over #earnings? It could delay the global earnings recovery long enough to cause a 10% P/E-driven correction in coming weeks. But if 30x is the new 20x, based on secular analogs, then some #investors may find a dip buyable.

The World Health Organization @WHO named the disease COVID-19 to distance it from a geographical location, an animal, an individual or group of people.

Cases of the #coronavairus COVID-19 are revised up 25% because of a diagnostic criteria change. Ok, but why would a diagnostic criteria change have the daily number of deaths rise 150% from 100 to 250? Is there more than one way to classify dead? Sounds a little weird.

Important observation albeit in alpha coronavirus, while SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) like seasonal HKU1 and OC43 is beta. No idea if this phenomenon would be different or not in beta.
