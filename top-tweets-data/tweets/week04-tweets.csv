Good to see both the BTS & Airport Rail Link releasing photos to show that they disinfect the carriages before use each day. The BTS also has hand sanitizer at the security checkpoint you can use.

If you're worried about #CoronaOutbreak, then you should really be worried about not vaccinating your kids. The anti-vaxx movement that has made vaccine hesitancy a top 10 global threat according to World Health Organization. Vaccinate your kids. Don't make measles great again.
"#Canada‚Äôs Minister of Health, Hon. Patty Hajdu, has issued a statement on the first presumptive confirmed case of #coronavirus #2019nCoV in #Ontario; all necessary precautions are being taken to prevent the spread of infection. Read here: https://bit.ly/2U7W0kX"
guys this isnt kpop related but it does affect my country and many others !! please please stay safe especially if you're in one of these affected countries and wear a mask for safety precautions! #WuhanCoronavirus #CoronavirusOutbreak 
Retweet to save lives. Kindly inform your family and friends. Prevention is way better than cure!!! #CoronaOutbreak 
Today I was hoping to get face masks, and it's sold out EVERYWHERE. As majority of Canadians are becoming aware of the China #coronavirus, please limit these to 1 box per customer verified with a valid üá®üá¶ ID to prevent the locust effect! Everyone should get a chance to buy them 
I‚Äôve spoken to Ontario Minister of Health @celliottability who has confirmed that Ontario has identified a case of novel #coronavirus in Toronto, pending confirmation by the National Microbiology Lab. https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/news/2020/01/statement-by-the-minister-of-health-on-the-first-presumptive-confirmed-traveled-related-case-of-new-coronavirus-in-canada.html
"""Don't politicize the #coronavirus"". Health care is political. Elections have consequences. Ontario currently has a government in charge who's cuts to public health have been harmful. Now you are seeing just how important public health &amp; preventative health care is. #onpoli"
How to wear mask , pls share this so that many people can learn the correct way #coronavirus #CoronaOutbreak #CoronavirusOutbreak 
1. We ARE already taking preventive measures 2. We ARE already restricting access for Wuhan travellers. Blanket restriction does not work anyway. 3. The prejudice against Chinese nationals over #coronavirus IS borne out of racism. ‚ÄúWon‚Äôt help?‚Äù Tell that to the online xenophobes 
Please take a moment to go through this poster and share with your loved ones. Some sources say the danger in the USA and Canada is way higher than what the health officials have reported. #CoronaOutbreak #coronavirus #CoronavirusOutbreak

If you‚Äôre worried about the #CoronaVirus, remember that 1.35 million people a year, 3.7K a day, are killed world-wide in traffic crashes, with another 20-50 million a year seriously injured. Via @WHO. Imagine if we were as committed to preventing THOSE deaths. #CoronaOutbreak

#UnitedStates has 63 suspected cases of #coronavirus 
Hearing there is one person with #coronavirus in Toronto... Me in Alberta which like 3000 km away from Toronto: 
#Coronavirus death toll has reached 55 as the first death from #Shanghai has been reported.
I am an Asian. Niether I am under the outbreak of #CoronaOutbreak but thinking to spread awareness. Can this spread and retweet as much as possible? I know its difficult infront of the funny memes which you like. #coronavirus #coronoavirus #coronarvirus #coronovirus
After canceling my trip back to #Wuhan from Ethiopia, I decided to travel to Rwanda instead. Almost every Chinese-looking person in the airport is wearing masks. Border control gives this form to screen passengers for the #coronavirus. WHO still not calling it a global emergency? 
Passengers from Guangzhou to Toronto on Jan 22nd With flight CZ311, you might have been infected. Pls stay at home for 14 days to prevent spread of #CoronaOutbreak CoronasVirus!
Viral pneumonias are common. Severe pneumonias are treated with supportive therapy until the immune system deals with the viral infection. We will weather the coronavirus just fine. #cdnpoli #onpoli #cdnhealth #coronavirus #onhealth @TOPublicHealth

Reminder: the CBC state broadcaster had Trudeau blackface photos but sat on them so as not to embarrass their boss. The story was broken by Time magazine. I predict most of the real reporting about #coronavirus in Canada will be done by the foreign press for the same reason. 
Medics in Wuhan are fighting are working to treat coronavirus patients and to keep the virus from spreading. See what it's like inside a hospital in Wuhan. #coronavirus https://newsus.cgtn.com/news/2020-01-26/Inside-a-Wuhan-hospital-as-medics-fight-the-coronavirus-NyGVLfCG52/index.html

Based on some quick research, it looks like there was only one flight from Guangzhou to Toronto on Jan 22, so the man who has #coronavirus was likely on CZ 311 (also known as MF 9861) that arrived at Pearson at 3:28pm on Thursday afternoon.

New #coronavirus can cause infections with no symptoms and sicken otherwise healthy people, studies show. 
At least 56 million people in 18 cities are now on lockdown in China - the virus has killed 41 people - this does NOT happen with only 1,300 cases globally. We aren‚Äôt getting close to the real infection numbers in China which must be close to 100k #coronavirus #CoronaOutbreak
