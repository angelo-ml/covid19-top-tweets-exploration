I'm usually not an alarmist about these things but China putting 5 cities with over 20 million people in them on lockdown over #CoronavirusOutbreak seems kind of significant? Also, can we lockdown San Francisco and LA to prevent contagion - not necessarily of coronavirus? 🤔

So, first case was in mid-December. Outbreak only confirmed in Jan. Symptoms show up 2-4 days after infection, but usually people only go to hospital when really ill, and by that time they’ve had ample contact with family, friends etc. Add travel to the equation...🥴#coronavirus

I am not declaring the new #coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of international concern today. The Emergency Committee was divided over whether the outbreak represents a PHEIC. This is an emergency in China, but it has not yet become a global health emergency. 
but isn’t this... exactly how #coronavirus spreads?

I'm not one to panic needlessly, but I don't think anyone is taking the Wuhan #coronavirus nearly seriously enough. As of yesterday, scientists presumed at least 10K infected in Wuhan alone. Infections will expand exponentially, with a preliminary fatality rate of around 2%. 1/2
Bats are considered as the original source of all major #coronavirus. This reminds me of a movie that I saw 8 years ago - Contagion. Didn’t think it was a great movie but obviously I went because of the cast.

Last few flights arriving and departing Wuhan right now. All remaining flights will be cancelled and the airport will be closed to prevent #coronavirus spreading. 
Public Health officials pressed the button. They're signaling #coronavirus is potentially serious. Resist compulsions: 'this is media panic'. Officials worldwide are going in front of the camera to talk. That's a sign. Be vigilant about precautions you should already take.

Very conflicted about what I should do next week: - Fly back to China? (it's currently the epicenter of the #coronavirus) - Train to New York? (dont have a place to sleep there) - Fly to Miami? (not invited) - Sit at my parents house confused? (probably my best option)
🦠 #Wuhan #coronavirus: #virus originated from an illegal animal market and is believed to have originated from a bat. He has already killed 9 people, there are at least 3000 cases. The authorities fear another change. The China virus is spreading quickly.

Why all should be concerned “The virus has an incubation period of 14 days before symptoms become manifest, the screening is “not foolproof” and the disease has no vaccine or drug cure.” A ‘normal’ person can already be a carrier. #coronavirus 
I wonder if the #coronavirus hysteria will be like the vaping hysteria from 5 months ago (remember that one?). I realize that one wasn’t a virus that could be transmitted but it also got a lot of airplay for relatively few cases 
Where do you believe the #coronavirus AKA Wuhan Flu originated?

#Beijing confirms 3 doctors infected with #coronavirus #2019nCoV #CoronaOutbreak 
#BREAKING: The most likely number of people infected from #CoronaOutbreak is around 6,000 cases - Researchers at Northeastern University and Imperial College London estimate
Ominous signs. Forbidden City (major tourist attraction) is now closed, and tours in #Beijing are now cancelled. I fear that #Beijing soon may be locked down, joining at least 11 of cities in #China with a collective 50+ million people. #2019nCoV #corona #CoronavirusOutbreak 
"Do you SERIOUSLY BELIEVE that the Communist Chinese government is ""quarantining"" over 40 MILLION people, in 15 cities (LARGEST QUARANTINE IN WORLD HISTORY!) because of just ""41 deaths""?!?!?! I VERY HIGHLY doubt it!! The TRUTH WILL come out!! Hopefully its SOON.. #CoronaOutbreak"
Just wondering - will African countries issue a travel advisory about China due to the #CoronaVirus? Sounds like it should be handled with the same severity as #Ebola

It was the Chinese president who stopped flights from Wuhan to Australia, not @ScottMorrisonMP. The PM has hesitated in ordering full biological screening of flights from origins of risk. Australia needs to stay ahead of the curve #auspol #coronavirus 
Do you think it's possible that this #coronavirus #outbreak was completely on purpose because the demonstrations in #HongKongProtests We're spreading to the mainland? Pathogen #TianamenSquare ?

Health authorities need their full attention on treating patients and stopping the #CoronavirusOutbreak. They make decisions based on facts, past lessons, and insight from experts, not public fears. The panic you create from sharing fake news wastes their time and resources.

Increase the AWARENESS,NOT ARGUING is WISER here. Every country already at a risk. We don't know who's safe who's don't. The incubation periods up to 15 days! Within that period of time, it's hard to recognize the sign symptom.Spread the news! #coronarvirus #CoronavirusOutbreak 
When #coronarvirus memes are spreading faster than #Coronavirus Coronavirus be like:-

New info on #Wuhan #CoronaVirus Study from #LancasterUniversity shows: 1. A person on aver. spreads the disease to 2-3 ppl = exponential growth. 2. 190 000 new cases expected just in Wuhan by Feb. 4th Minister of Health M. Xiaowei said today the virus has grown more contagious
Are you worried about contracting or dying from #coronavirus? You shouldn’t be unless you’ve just come back from Wuhan. To put things in perspective, in the last 7 days, 332 people died on the roads in Thailand. Worry about that instead #ไวรัสโคโรน่า #ไวรัสโคโรนาสายพันธุ์ใหม่
#LIVE The police have surrounded around a hundred residents and first aiders in Fanling in a large stop and search action. These residents have been protesting against the government’s plans to build a #coronavirus quarantine quarter near their buildings without consultation. 
Truth from China: 1. The officials have escaped to some isolated island to “give instruction” 2. The virus may have spread since months ago before the lockdown 3. Chinese “officials” are not to be trusted. #CoronaOutbreak 
🚨BREAKING: a 3rd case of #coronavirus confirmed in the U.S. (woman who traveled from #Wuhan). Meanwhile, the number of cases in #China increased by 50% in just 24 hours. This is just the beginning of the #CoronavirusOutbreak. #2019nCoV
France, Japan and the USA are evacuating their citizens from Wuhan. If Canada doesn't act now too, they'll be in lock-down in the city indefinitely and endangered more. Get them out and quarantined for whatever the incubation period is. #cdnpoli #coronarvirus #CoronaOutbreak

The number of laboratory confirmed cases of the new Wuhan #coronavirus in China has been doubling every two days. That's crazy fast. In part, this may be due to labs playing catch-up on a backlog of samples? The death toll now stands at 56 (+15 from yesterday). 
Leading Chinese epidemiologist George Fu says SARS took 3 months to become easily transmissible between humans but the new #coronavirus did that in 1 month. “The viruses are adapting to humans” and vice versa I.e we get less sick, he said. And he repeatedly said not to panic.
