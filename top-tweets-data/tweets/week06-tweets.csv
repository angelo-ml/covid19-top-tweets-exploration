In memory of the courage of Dr Li Wenliang. A many who has saved many lives by his actions. “He who holds the firewood for the masses is the one who freezes to death in wind and snow.” #CoronavirusOutbreak #Corona #coronaviruswuhan #Coronavius
Imagine the indignity of being paraded to shill for the CCP like this. “It’s very important things can be resolved so that trade relations can resume” Yeah I don’t think that will give #coronavirus victims great consolation, you myopic ghouls. 
Chinese Netizens and Expert Suspect Wuhan Bioresearch Lab Is the Source of the Coronavirus https://www.theepochtimes.com/involvement-of-wuhan-p4-lab-questioned_3230182.html via @epochtimes #China #Wuhan #Coronavirus #Bioweapons #BioResearch
The numbers of new #coronavirus cases out of China remain relatively linear, varying from day to day within a narrow band. Tonight’s update is no different. It suggests that testing capacity may be influencing the reported cases more than epidemiology.
Consensus is now the #coronavirus spreads faster than SARS it mostly seems. Likely less lethal. But it will spread more than the seasonal flu at this rate. (Seasonal influenza has a median R0=1.28 for comparison https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/25186370/)

Disturbing from Communist China. Chinese government are only suspecting these people have been exposed & therefore are going to quarantine them w/ people who have #coronavirus. They are fighting because they don’t want to be quarantined w/ the infected. 
400 million in quarantine for 640 dead people. Also I’m the son of Darth Vader. #coronavirus 
Wuhan checkpoint are now being manned by the Chinese Army and they’re checking for fever. The Chinese government has put the quarantined zones under military control. But nothing to worry about! It’s just the flu! #coronavirus
Reports are surfacing that #Coronavirus found its way into humans via Pangolin meat. Maybe now the Chinese will stop hunting these cool little guys. Karma! 
Today the people of China mourns. Today the world mourns. Dr Li Wenliang first raised the alarm to Chinese authorities about #CoronaVirus He was called a liar. Earlier today he died. And the whole of China blows a whistle to mourn him. A true hero. A whistleblower we all love. 
The #coronavirus epidemic highlights the over-dependence of our companies on one country, #China, that is both unreliable and hostile to America. We must, as a national priority, manufacture at or close to home. #ProximityManufacturing

Remaining Australians on the ground in #Wuhan say they're being told to get to the airport tonight at 6pm for a 12:15am evacuation flight. This is likely to be the last Australian evac flight out of the epicentre #CoronavirusOutbreak
The raw emotion and anger that Li Wenliang’s death has unleashed here shouldn’t be understated. #China’s authorities sought to silence his concern of the #coronavirus outbreak in a city where they’re now doing house searches and rounding up sick people in an effort to contain it. 
Why is the #Coronavirus infection so hard for the Communist Party to contain? The Party has lost all trust of the Chinese people. Social cohesion is necessary for stopping disease. #China #Dobbs @LouDobbs

#coronavirus update: Total cases, 37.5K. Overall mortality, 2.1%. Global ICU recovery, 77.4% (#china, 71%). Global infection, 0.9% of total. @WHO has said this is NOT global pandemic, no travel restrictions. #nepal has 1 confirmed case. Why are some of us still panicking ?
A scene from a major city in China. They do this since weeks. The only reason to do this is when the #Coronavirus is airborne. How long have they known? 
Chinese health authorities have dispatched a total of 11,921 medical personnels from across the country to Hubei Province to aid the fight against the novel #coronavirus pneumonia, said the National Health Commission on Sunday. 
"“[The govt is] left with so little legitimacy and social capital that citizens simply no longer believe it will act in their interests.” HK’s handing of the #coronavirus crisis would be bad for any city; for a modern, global metropolis that weathered SARS, it’s an embarrassment. "

There are simple things we can all do to slow the spread of almost any germs, including #coronavirus. Catch your cough or sneeze in a tissue, bin the tissue, and wash your hands with soap and water, or use sanitiser gel: http://gov.uk/coronavirus

No Dignity when living in #China’s #coronavirus outbreak. 2 women dragged from home to be quarantined. Trousers were pulled off (1.34) during the struggle. Netizens: so many are scared of dying at #nCoV2019 quarantine ctr, as lack of medical care. .
#coronavirus doesn't block love.❤️ These nurses volunteered to support Wuhan and cut their hair to make their work more convenient. 👏👼🏻 
Imagine #coronavirus 
The fact that no #coronavirus case isn't yet reported in Africa is a problem to many. BBC, England : Africa are you ready ?😳 Parisien , France : Why is Africa not yet affected ?😳 They don't know that God is bigger than science. 
Cute figures found! After the breakout of #coronavirus, many citizens wear inflatable dolls instead of protective suits to protect them. An astronaut, a cute bear and even a Christmas tree are being seen on the street. These figures partly relax the tension of this tough period.

No Doctors. No medicine. Toilets are outside, 200 meters away. No showers. No food. No water. Does this sound like a hospital or a death camp? #CoronaVirus #Wuhan @SenTomCotton #PrayForChjna
A security guard working at a #Guangzhou hospital amid the #CoronavirusOutbreak says he drinks less water to avoid using the bathroom so he doesn't have to change into a new protective suit every time he gets out, as medical staff need the gear the most. Here is his story. 
"A 6-month-old baby diagnosed with the #coronavirus and quarantined alone at a Wuhan hospital has ""nurse moms"" taking care of him 24/7. The baby's mother is a medical professional who contracted the virus at work, and his grandparents have also been quarantined. "

Called a friend in #China China today. She said sometimes people threw bodies away after they died of #coronavirus, as nobody would come to collect them. Crematoria too busy. Cannot leave the bodies at home. This is really hard to take although I've seen many bad enough things.
A KFC employee who was responsible for food preparation in Xi'an, Northwest China's Shaanxi Province was confirmed infected with the #coronavirus. #NCP
More than 34,500 people worldwide have been infected by the #coronavirus, which continues to spread to more countries since it was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December, 2019. How does coronavirus spread and how can you protect yourself?

Walked into a shop in rural Australia: - “You uh... know anyone in China?” - “Um... I’ve got family in Hong Kong” (I decided against disclosing the fact that I too live there) - “How bad is the virus there?” 🤦🏻‍♀️ #CoronaOutbreak
Encouraging! China's new confirmed cases of novel #coronavirus infection outside of Hubei has been dropping for five consecutive days http://xhne.ws/9aXRZ

Basically, media jumped on a baseless rumor to scare everyone with #coronavirus to boost ratings/clicks, and the end result is 4000+ people had their vacation ruined for no reason. Media hype over this needs to end 
The routes of the novel #coronavirus infection include transmission via aerosol according to Chinese health and epidemic prevention experts. The other major routes of virus infection are contact transmission and direct transmission. https://bit.ly/38dchZM

The 🦠 has now crossed the rubicon... the new #coronavirus deaths toll has exceeded SARS. And instead of 9 months (38 weeks) to hit 800, it took just 6 weeks. That’s more than 6x faster 🤒 
China is currently at war, fighting the unknown enemy. Chinese people need all the moral support now. Let’s remember them in our prayers and desist from making negative comments online about the #coronavirus epidemic affecting them. I wish the whole world will see this tweet.
