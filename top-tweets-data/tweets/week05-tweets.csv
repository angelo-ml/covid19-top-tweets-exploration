After 2 high-ranking gov't officials in #Hubei Province died from the #Coronavirus, many officials are getting special IVIG injections to protect themselves. Meanwhile, locals who have symptoms of the deadly virus are being turned away by hospitals. 
News: Today, @SecAzar signed a public health emergency declaration in response to the 2019 Novel #Coronavirus outbreak. 
Bay Area's 1st #coronavirus case confirmed in Santa Clara County. There are zero cases of novel coronavirus in SF right now, but you can still practice these tips to keep yourself and others healthy. Get the facts from CDC: https://cdc.gov/coronavirus/index.html‚Ä¶

Strategies to prevent entry of #coronavirus into U.S. are smart critical steps. But we should also work from posture that assumes some index cases already arrived undetected and virus now circulating. Key to limiting outbreaks will be broadening screening guidance to physicians.

A Pro-Trump Blog Has Doxed A Chinese Scientist It Falsely Accused Of Creating The #Coronavirus As A Bioweapon https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanhatesthis/a-pro-trump-blog-has-doxed-a-chinese-scientist-it-falsely
üßµ As the Trump administration reckons with the #coronavirus outbreak, recall how Donald Trump reacted to the Ebola epidemic ‚Äì in tweets, interviews, and news conferences. In a public health emergency, he saw political opportunity.

The trade in wild animals doesn't only endanger species, it is also the source of many major human disease outbreaks. China must make this ban permanent, for the sake of people and #wildlife. #coronavirus 
At this time, the risk to Americans remains low, and we are working to keep it that way. We will continue our work to monitor, respond to, and mitigate the spread of the #coronavirus and ensure that Americans have the most accurate and up-to-date health and travel information. 
.@realDonaldTrump takes strong action, declares public health emergency, quarantines and travel limitations due to #Coronavirus. He‚Äôs not messing around - this is exactly why we elected him.
#Coronavirus is public health emergency in America now says the Trump regime. Trump is probably worried the stock market dropped 600 points today. 
China has imported 290 million yuan (about 41.8 million U.S. dollars) worth of medical supplies in a single week to ease domestic shortages amid efforts to contain the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, customs data showed Friday. 
India just announced that the #coronavirus had at least 4 protein inserts from HIV, which is a sign of engineering, leading them to believe this was an engineered bioweapon. The original link was pulled almost immediately. 
As part of the Administration‚Äôs work to protect Americans and respond to the 2019 Novel #Coronavirus outbreak, today I signed a public health emergency declaration.
